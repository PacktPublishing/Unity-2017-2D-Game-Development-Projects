# Unity 2017 2D Game Development Projects
This is the code repository for [Unity 2017 2D Game Development Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-2017-2d-game-development-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460271), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
2D games are everywhere! Timeless and popular, 2D games represent a substantial segment of the games market. The Unity engine has revolutionized the gaming industry, by making it easier for game developers to create quality games on a budget. If you are looking for a guide to create 2D games using Unity 2017, look no further. With this book, you will learn all the essentials of 2D game development by creating three epic games in a step-by-step manner throughout the course of this book.

The first game will have you collecting as many cakes as possible. The second will transport you to outer space to traverse as far as possible while avoiding enemy spaceships. The last game will have you running and jumping across platforms to collect coins and other exotic items.

Throughout all these three games, you will create characters, make them move, and create some enemies. And then, of course, write code to destroy them!. After showing you the necessities of creating a game, this book will then help you to porting the game to a mobile platform, and provide a path to publish it on the stores.

By the end of this book, you will not only have created three complete great games, but be able to apply your knowledge to create and deploy your own games.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
void FixedUpdate () {
        //Get the new position of our character
        var x = transform.position.x + Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * Time.deltaTime * speed;
        var y = transform.position.y + Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * Time.deltaTime * speed;
    }
```

In order to get the most out of this book, it's preferable that you have had some experience with some programming languages (specifically C#). Although this book will teach you how to script in Unity, this is not a programming book. In saying that, this book does not assume that you have any prior knowledge of Unity, scripting, or the other free programs that we will use. As a result, I highly recommend that you jump into the first chapter and start exploring the book. In fact, you can always revise sections of this book once you have developed your skills and understanding.
